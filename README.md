# Guentur_MagentoImport

I have problems with naming programming entities. To deal with this issue I have to:
1. Read books about programming architecture in English
2. Push my code to a much more relevant programmer to hear advices from them. I think it has even  more influence than reading books
3. Work with different projects, not with Magento only to see many ways to name programming entities
